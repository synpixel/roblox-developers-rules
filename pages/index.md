## Rule 1: Respect other members

This means:

- No hate speech.
- No racist comments.
- No sexist or transphobic comments.
- Avoid ableism or elitism.
- No discriminatory language.
  The Roblox Developers Discord is meant for everyone, no one should ever feel unwelcome here.

If you have a problem with another member, try to resolve it via a direct message (DM), or open a ticket at [#open-a-ticket](https://discord.com/channels/489424959270158356/639890173869555761). We may occasionally create a thread to discuss disagreements publicly.

## Rule 2: No excessive swearing

Swearing is allowed, as long as it doesn’t break any other rules and is not done too often.

We do not ban the use of words. Instead, we use context to determine if a rule was broken.

## Rule 3: No advertising

Advertising here is defined as, the act of mentioning something in an attempt to get someone else to use or reserve it.

Exceptions
You may post an advertisement in these circumstances:

- The channel topic allows it.
- It is directly related to and in response to a conversation.
- It does not directly or indirectly benefit you, would not be disruptive, and would be beneficial to a majority of members.

This includes advertising in members' direct messages using our server.

## Rule 4: No spam, age-restricted or annoying content

Spam is defined as, posting the same or similar content repeatedly.
Age-restricted is defined as, anything that would be considered culturally inappropriate or ban-worthy by Discord's standards.
Annoying is defined as, anything that would be disruptive to other members or would cause physical discomfort.

We have systems in place to avoid this, but they are imperfect.

Exceptions
The [#⁠immature-chat](https://discord.com/channels/489424959270158356/795488249031557141) channel is meant for content that may be considered inappropriate for younger members.

- Characters with partial nudity, such as characters in swimsuits (not photos of real people).
- Suggestive emojis, such as portraits of sexualized characters.
- More excessive swearing.
- Anything that Discord allows that is within a Mature ESRB rating.
- Profile descriptions do not need to follow our rules.

Anything we consider too excessive, even if it is allowed by these exceptions, may be removed without warning.

## Rule 5: Use channels for their intended purpose

Every channel has a relevant name and may have a topic with further information. Always read the topic before using a channel.

Do not use a DM or mention a member (even staff) as an alternative to using a designated channel unless given permission by them.

If you have a question about a channel, ask a moderator or administrator.

## Rule 6: Always listen to staff

Moderators may warn you if they believe you did something wrong. Always listen to them, even if what you did was not in the rules. Failure to listen to a moderator may result in further punishment.

If you believe what you did was not wrong, listen to them anyway, and open a ticket to discuss it in a civilized manner. Mistakes happen, everyone has room to grow.

## Rule 7: Discord Terms of Service and Community Guidelines are enforced

Always follow Discord's rules. If any of our rules contradict a Discord rule, Discord's rule must take priority.

We are in no way affiliated with or endorsed by Roblox. We can not and will not enforce the Roblox Terms of Service here. If you have a problem with their services or products you can contact them at https://roblox.com/support
